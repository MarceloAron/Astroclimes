Welcome to the documentation for Astroclimes!
===================================

**Astroclimes** is a synthetic transmission algorithm that can be used to measure the abundance of greenhouse gases in
the Earth's atmosphere and to remove telluric lines from stellar spectra.

Please cite `Fetzner Keniger et al. (2025) <https://academic.oup.com/rasti/article/doi/10.1093/rasti/rzaf041/8258953>`_ if you use Astroclimes in your research.
