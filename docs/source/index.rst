Welcome to the documentation for Astroclimes!
===================================

**Astroclimes** is a synthetic transmission algorithm that can be used to measure the abundance of greenhouse gases in
the Earth's atmosphere using astronomical observations or to remove telluric lines from stellar spectra.

Please cite `Fetzner Keniger et al. (2025) <https://academic.oup.com/rasti/article/doi/10.1093/rasti/rzaf041/8258953>`_ if you use Astroclimes in your research.
